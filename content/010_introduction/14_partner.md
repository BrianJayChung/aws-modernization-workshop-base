# What is LaunchDarkly?

LaunchDarkly is a feature management platform that empowers all teams to safely deliver and control software through feature flags. Feature flags are if-else statements that decouple code deployments from feature releases, giving you control over which end-users see which features. LaunchDarkly allows teams to leverage the power of feature flags on a massive scale across a variety of complex use cases. The ability to separate deployments from releases allows developers to safely ship code to production whenever they want, at the same time, allowing the business to release that code to end-users when they're ready.

LaunchDarkly also enables you to use feature flags to test new features on a small subset of users in production via canary tests, beta tests, and experiments. If the new feature causes an issue in production, you can simply turn off the corresponding feature flag (i.e., hit a kill switch) without having to perform any restarts or redeploys. And if all goes well with the initial tests, you can gradually roll out the new feature to your broader user base at your own pace.

LaunchDarkly gives teams the control and confidence to deploy fearlessly.
